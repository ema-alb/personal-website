    content: "Welcome to my personal website! Congrats, by landing on this webpage you gained +1 point in awesomeness! :partying_face:<br>
    Let me introduce myself: I'm Ema (people abroad confuse it with \"Emma\"), an Italian guy :it: who's fond of technology :laptop: and solving problems :puzzle_piece: (the more complex, the better!).
    I consider myself a person who works diligently, but also likes to cheer the team up with some jokes and memes :smile:.<br>
    My journey starts at the age of 14, when I started tinkering with technology by flashing a stock firmware on my first cellphone (the glorious Samsung U700 EVO) to remove all the 
    carrier's bloatware from the operating system. From then on, my next Android and iOS devices were often tweaked and modded in order to get the best out them (whether it
    was for performance :rocket: or energy efficiency :battery:): that's how curious I am to discover how things work and how to improve them. I have been studying computer science and programming ever since.<br>
    Fast forward few years and here I am, a graduate :mortar_board: computer engineer üë®üèº‚Äçüíª specialized in data analysis who enjoys to apply his know-how in challenging fields.
    Due to my competitiveness, I am now challenging myself by working in the financial world as an *Equity ETF trader* :chart:, where both the competition :smirk: and the stakes :moneybag: are very high.
    Nonetheless, I also keep working on data-related tasks :bar_chart:, as I am and have been assigned different responsibilities which allow me to work closely with data and machine learning :robot:, my core competencies.<br><br>
    I'm so grateful that I've been surrounded mostly by very talented and clever people that fostered in me a strong desire to get better at what I do and learn more.
    Kudos to my current and past colleagues, you really inspire me!<br><br>
    
    **Sports I enjoy**: go-karting :checkered_flag:, soccer (I'm a goalkeeper) :soccer_ball:, weightlifting üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, ski :skier:, swimming üèäüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, basketball :basketball:, volleyball :volleyball: and billiards :8ball:.<br>
    **What I love :heart:**: my cat :cat2:, pizza :pizza:, boardgames :game_die: ([Puerto Rico](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108687/puerto-rico) my fav, [play with me!](https://boardgamearena.com/player?id=85598935)),
    lofi music :headphones:, languages :earth_africa:, and emojis (did anyone notice? :eyes:).<br>
    **Big NOs üëéüèº**: ideological extremisms (of all sorts and aspects)."

          During the first and only year of my PhD I delved deeper into advanced Deep Learning methods, focusing mainly on the domain shift issue in Computer Vision, i.e. when the data distribution changes from train to test time.<br>
          Though brief, this experience taught me to effectively read academic papers, work on complicated problems and strive to improve the state-of-the-art, trying to bring valuable contributions to the scientific community.<br>
          I enhanced my knowledge of Convolutional Neural Networks, the ability to spot alternative and meliorative solutions to existing ones, and the capability of working under stress and tight deadlines.<br>
          I was also selected by the [Coll√®ge des Ing√©nieurs](https://cdi.eu) to take part to the [Innovation for Change (I4C) program](https://www.innovation4change.eu) wherein I worked on a project
